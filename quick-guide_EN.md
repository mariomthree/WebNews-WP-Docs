# Quick guide

To make your website look similar to the WebNews demo, follow the 3 basic configuration steps.

## 1. Install the theme
To install it is very simple, go to Appearances> Themes> Add new. Search for the theme or upload the .zip file, if you downloaded the theme manually.

## 2. Install the recommended plugin
Install all recommended plugins, mainly M3 Toolbox. When installing the theme for the first time, a message appears at the top informing you of the necessary plugins.

## 3. Import the demo content
The last step is optional, but this is the easiest way to start styling your site using WebNews, as it will reproduce the demo site on its own site. Demo content is available on the theme author's GitHub, download and import using All ine one wp migration.
